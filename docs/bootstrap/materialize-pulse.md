Draw attention to your buttons with a subtle pulse effect. You can do it by adding `pulse` class to your	 button.
 
<div class="note">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This works best for floating buttons, so it may not work perfectly with other components.</p>
</div>

```html
<a class="btn-floating pulse"><i class="material-icons">menu</i></a>
<a class="btn-floating btn-large pulse"><i class="material-icons">cloud</i></a>
<a class="btn-floating btn-large cyan pulse"><i class="material-icons">edit</i></a>
```
