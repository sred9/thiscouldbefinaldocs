### Switch
```html
<div class="switch">
   <label>
   Off
   <input type="checkbox">
   <span class="lever"></span>
   On
   </label>
</div>
 ``` 
 
### Disabled Switch

You can create a disabled switch by passing the `disabled` attribute to the `input` tag.

```html
<div class="switch">
   <label>
   Off
   <input disabled type="checkbox">
   <span class="lever"></span>
   On
   </label>
</div>	
 ```
