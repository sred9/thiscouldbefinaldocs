We have included 932 Material Design Icons courtesy of Google. You can download them directly from the Material Design specs.

To be able to use these icons, you must include this line in the <head>portion of your HTML code.

```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons" rel="stylesheet">
```

To use these icons, use the material-icons class on an element and provide the ligature as the text content.

```html
<i class="material-icons">add</i>
```

## Sizes

To control the size of the icon, change the font-size: 30px property of your icon. Optionally you can use preset classes as shown below.

| CSS class  | Icon size |
|--------|-----------|
| tiny   | 1rem      |
| small  | 2rem      |
| medium | 4rem      |
| large  | 6rem      |

```html
<i class="large material-icons">insert_chart</i>
```
